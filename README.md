Hobbit time!
============

I'd like to think hobbits tell time by the grumbling in their tummies.

Starting at 5am (and 'sleep' otherwise):
- almost breakfast
- breakfast
- seven-ish
- almost second breakfast
- second breakfast
- almost elevenses
- elevenses
- luncheon
- sleep
- afternoon tea
- three-ish
- almost dinner
- dinner
- almost supper
- supper
- eight-ish
- nine-ish
